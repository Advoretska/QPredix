# QPredix
This is Qt/C++ SDK for Predix Ge services API (https://www.predix.io/) developed by [Indeema Software Inc.](https://indeema.com/). It works for MacOS, Linux and Windows operation systems.

## Documentation
## Minimum requirements
Qt 5.8

### Installing
Just use qpm (https://www.qpm.io/) to install QPredix in your project.
Run qpm install com.indeema.QPredix

### How to start
A simple example you can find in [QPredixSamples folder](https://github.com/IndeemaSoftware/QPredix/tree/master/QPredixSamples). 

Copy QPredix folder to your project and add 

  include(QPredix.pri) 

to your project *.pro file. Then we need to initialize it with QUaaInfo:

    QUaaInfo lInfo;
    lInfo.setUaaUrl("your UaaUrl taken from Predix Uaa service");
    lInfo.setClientCredential("Client id", "secret");

Then setup user with QUaaUserInfo:

    QUaaUserInfo lUser;
    lUser.setLogin("user credentials");
    lUser.setPassword("user password");
    
now you can start using Uaa service:

    QUaa *mUaa = new QUaa(lInfo);
    connect(mUaa, SIGNAL(loginSucced(QUaa*)), this, SLOT(loginSucceed()));
    mUaa->loginWithCredentials(lUser);

don't forget to initialize loginSucceed() slot;

After login is succeed you are able to start using TimeSeries service provided by Prexid:

    QTimeSeries *mTimeSeries = new QTimeSeries(mUaa);
    mTimeSeries->setZoneID("Your zone ID");
    
Now ingest data to timeseries service:
    
    QMap<QString, QString> lAtt;
    lAtt.insert("vector", "x");
    mTimeSeries->sendData("TEST1", 2, 3, lAtt);
    
First parameter is tag name, the second is value, the third is quality and the third is custom attributes.
There is more simple way to ingest data iwth only tag and value with default quality 3 and without attributes:

    mTimeSeries->sendData("TEST1", "0");

**If device doesn't have connection to internet, all data is stored locally until connection will apear. After connection is available all local data is synced with server**
